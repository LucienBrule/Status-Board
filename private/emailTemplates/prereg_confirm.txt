Hello,

Hooray! You have successfully preregistered for HackRPI 2016! What does this mean?

 - You have made it onto the HackRPI 2016 Mailing List!
 - You will be one first notified when registration opens for real, which is important because acceptance is on a rolling, first-come, first-served basis.
 - You're awesome.

Remember, this does not mean that you are registered for HackRPI 2016. Look for registration to open early September!
